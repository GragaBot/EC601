This software is designed for astronomy to estimate the possible numbers
of electrons on the earth, and convert this number to an equivalent 
number of terabytes (TB).Here we consider the earth as a giant
supercomputer, and each electron represents a bit of storage. The 
software will compute and present the upper and lower boundaries and 
the average value of the result.
